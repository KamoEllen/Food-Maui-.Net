## ðŸ¥¢ Project Overview

This is a **UI implementation** of a food detail page for a **sushi restaurant**, built using **.NET MAUI**. The design is based on a Figma wireframe and includes a clean, grid-based layout to display dish details.

The project took **1 day** to complete and served as a valuable hands-on practice with:

* **Grids** and layout management
* **MAUI tags and UI elements**
* Understanding how **a single app page may require multiple XAML/C# files** in MAUI

I've included:

* A **demo of me coding the page**
* A screenshot showing the **wireframe and the final UI**
